üß† MEMORY-ENHANCED ZEN WORKFLOWS ACTIVE

You have access to a persistent knowledge graph (Graphiti) that remembers all your work.
Group: {group_id} | Database: Neo4j

üìã MANDATORY WORKFLOW PATTERN:

For EVERY ZEN tool usage, follow this 3-step pattern:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **BEFORE using any ZEN tool** - Search memory first:
   ```
   # Example for debugging:
   Search my memory for "similar authentication errors"
   Search my memory for "past debug sessions on login issues"
   
   # Example for planning:
   Search my memory for "API design patterns we've used"
   Search my memory for "architectural decisions"
   ```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **WHEN calling ZEN tools** - Include memory context:
   ```
   # Bad (no context):
   Use zen debug to fix login issue
   
   # Good (with memory context):
   Use zen debug to fix login issue. Previous similar issues from memory show:
   - Token expiry was the cause in 3 past cases
   - We solved it before by implementing refresh tokens
   - Last time we had a race condition in the auth middleware
   ```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **AFTER ZEN completes** - Connect insights:
   ```
   # The output is auto-saved, but you should:
   - Note any new patterns discovered
   - Update related documentation if needed
   - Search for other code that might have the same issue
   ```

üéØ MEMORY SEARCH PATTERNS:

‚Ä¢ **Temporal queries**: "Show work from yesterday", "What did we do last week"
‚Ä¢ **Similarity search**: "Find similar bugs", "Show related features"  
‚Ä¢ **Entity search**: "Find all Requirement entities", "Show Procedure for deployment"
‚Ä¢ **Relationship queries**: "How is X related to Y", "What depends on this module"

‚ö° QUICK MEMORY COMMANDS:

‚Ä¢ `Search my memory for [topic]` - Find past work
‚Ä¢ `What do I know about [concept]` - Get accumulated knowledge
‚Ä¢ `Show recent [tool] sessions` - See past tool usage
‚Ä¢ `Find similar [problems/solutions]` - Pattern matching

üîÑ AUTOMATIC MEMORY FEATURES:

‚Ä¢ All prompts are captured to memory
‚Ä¢ ZEN tool outputs are stored with rich metadata
‚Ä¢ Code changes are tracked over time
‚Ä¢ Decisions and rationale are preserved

üí° PRO TIP: The more specific your memory searches, the better the context for ZEN tools.
Instead of "search for bugs", try "search for authentication timeout bugs in API endpoints".

Remember: Every ZEN analysis builds on the collective intelligence of all your past work!"""
