# Claude Code Hook Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the performance optimizations implemented in the Claude Code hook system. The optimized hooks provide significant performance improvements through parallel execution, smart caching, and asynchronous operations.

## Performance Improvements

### Measured Performance Gains

## Optimized Hooks

### 1. PreToolUse Hook (`pre_tool_use.py`)

**Optimizations:**
- Parallel validation of multiple validators
- Cached validation results with TTL
- Circuit breaker for resilient validation
- Performance metrics tracking

**Key Features:**
```python
# Parallel validation for bash commands
validators = [
    ("command_safety", validate_bash_safety),
    ("command_resources", check_command_resources)
]
results = parallel_validator.validate_parallel(tool_input, validators)

# Smart caching
cache_key = f"{tool_name}:{json.dumps(tool_input, sort_keys=True)}"
cached_result = validator_cache.get(cache_key)
```

### 2. PostToolUse Hook (`post_tool_use.py`)

**Optimizations:**
- Asynchronous metric recording
- Parallel drift analysis
- Pattern detection with bounded storage
- Pipeline-based processing

**Key Features:**
```python
# Asynchronous database writes
async_db.write({
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "tool": tool_name,
    "success": success,
    "duration": duration
})

# Parallel drift detection
analyzers = [
    ("sequential_drift", detect_sequential_drift),
    ("coordination_drift", detect_coordination_drift),
    ("resource_drift", detect_resource_drift)
]
```

### 3. SessionStart Hook (`session_start.py`)

**Optimizations:**
- Parallel session component initialization
- Cached session context
- Pre-warmed hook pools
- Asynchronous session storage

**Key Features:**
```python
# Parallel initialization
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = {
        executor.submit(initialize_session_tracking): "tracking",
        executor.submit(load_neural_patterns): "neural",
        executor.submit(detect_github_context): "github",
        executor.submit(count_active_validators): "validators"
    }
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable optimization features
export CLAUDE_HOOKS_OPTIMIZATION=true
export CLAUDE_HOOKS_CACHE_SIZE=1000
export CLAUDE_HOOKS_POOL_SIZE=4
export CLAUDE_HOOKS_ASYNC_BATCH_SIZE=50
```

### Performance Tuning

1. **Cache Configuration**
   ```python
   ValidatorCache(
       ttl_seconds=300,    # 5 minute cache
       max_size=1000       # Maximum cached items
   )
   ```

2. **Pool Configuration**
   ```python
   HookExecutionPool(
       max_workers=4,      # Parallel workers
       queue_size=100      # Maximum queued tasks
   )
   ```

3. **Circuit Breaker Configuration**
   ```python
   HookCircuitBreaker(
       failure_threshold=5,     # Failures before opening
       recovery_timeout=30.0,   # Recovery period (seconds)
       success_threshold=3      # Successes to close
   )
   ```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Performance Dashboard

The `performance_dashboard.py` provides real-time monitoring:

```python
dashboard = PerformanceDashboard()
stats = dashboard.get_aggregated_stats()

# Outputs:
# - Average execution time per hook
# - Cache hit rates
# - Memory usage statistics
# - Error rates and circuit breaker status
```

### Metrics Collection

Metrics are automatically collected in:
- `/home/devcontainers/flowed/.claude/hooks/cache/metrics.json`
- `/home/devcontainers/flowed/.claude/hooks/db/hooks.db`

## Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Caching
- Validation results are cached for 5 minutes
- Identical tool calls skip validation
- Cache keys include tool name and inputs

### 2. Use Parallel Processing
- Multiple validators run concurrently
- Session components initialize in parallel
- Drift analyzers execute simultaneously

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check cache hit rates regularly
- Monitor circuit breaker status
- Track execution times

### 4. Resource Management
- Pools automatically manage resources
- Graceful shutdown on exit
- Memory bounds prevent leaks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce cache size: `max_size=500`
   - Lower pool workers: `max_workers=2`
   - Enable aggressive eviction

2. **Circuit Breaker Open**
   - Check error logs for failures
   - Verify external dependencies
   - Adjust failure threshold

3. **Slow Performance**
   - Check cache hit rates
   - Verify parallel execution
   - Monitor system resources

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
export CLAUDE_HOOKS_DEBUG=true
```

This provides detailed logs for:
- Cache hits/misses
- Parallel execution timing
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Memory usage patterns

## Migration Notes

### From Original to Optimized

The optimized hooks are drop-in replacements:

1. Original files backed up as `.original`
2. Optimized versions maintain same API
3. Fallback to original behavior on errors
4. No configuration changes required

### Rollback Procedure

If needed, restore original hooks:
```bash
cd /home/devcontainers/flowed/.claude/hooks
cp pre_tool_use.py.original pre_tool_use.py
cp post_tool_use.py.original post_tool_use.py
cp session_start.py.original session_start.py
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Optimizations

1. **Distributed Caching**
   - Redis integration for shared cache
   - Cross-session cache persistence
   - Cache synchronization

2. **Advanced Metrics**
   - Real-time performance graphs
   - Anomaly detection
   - Predictive optimization

3. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Pattern prediction
   - Adaptive thresholds
   - Performance forecasting

### Contributing

To add new optimizations:

1. Create module in `/modules/optimization/`
2. Integrate with existing pipeline
3. Add metrics collection
4. Update documentation

## Conclusion

The optimized hooks provide significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility and reliability. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization based on specific needs.
