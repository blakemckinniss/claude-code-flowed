# Claude Code Configuration - ZEN Orchestration Environment

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Claude Hook → ZEN → Claude Flow Integration

This project represents a revolutionary **Claude Hook → ZEN → Claude Flow** integration that creates an intelligent, self-optimizing development environment. The system uses hooks as the primary intelligence layer, with ZEN orchestration and Claude Flow execution forming a complete AI-powered development ecosystem.

## 🪝 Hook System: The Brain of the Operation

The hook system is the **most critical component** of this integration. Hooks intercept every action, analyze context, and provide intelligent guidance in real-time.

### UserPromptSubmit Hook: The Crown Jewel 👑

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook is **the most important hook** in the system. It:

1. **Intercepts Every User Prompt** - Before Claude processes any request
2. **Analyzes Context Intelligence** - Using the Context Intelligence Engine
3. **Detects Task Complexity** - Automatically determines required orchestration
4. **Injects ZEN Directives** - Provides context-aware guidance
5. **Enforces Best Practices** - Ensures optimal patterns are followed

#### How UserPromptSubmit Works

```python
# When you type a prompt, the hook:
1. Analyzes git context, tech stack, and project state
2. Determines complexity level and required agents
3. Injects context-aware directives via stdout
4. Guides you to use appropriate MCP tools (ZEN/Claude Flow)
```

### Other Critical Hooks

1. **SessionStart Hook** - Loads project context and memory
2. **PreToolUse Hook** - Validates and optimizes tool usage
3. **PostToolUse Hook** - Tracks results and updates learning
4. **Stop/SubagentStop Hooks** - Manages session continuity

## 🧠 ZEN MCP Tools: The Orchestration Layer

ZEN provides intelligent orchestration through MCP tools:

- `mcp__zen__chat` - Interactive collaboration
- `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` - Deep analysis and investigation
- `mcp__zen__planner` - Sequential planning and breakdown
- `mcp__zen__consensus` - Multi-model consensus building
- `mcp__zen__analyze` - Comprehensive code analysis
- `mcp__zen__debug` - Systematic debugging workflows

## 🌊 Claude Flow: The Execution Layer

Claude Flow manages multi-agent swarms and coordination:

- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Initialize swarm topologies
- `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Create specialized agents
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` - Break down complex tasks
- `mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage` - Persistent memory management

## 🚀 How the Integration Works

### 1. User Submits Prompt
- UserPromptSubmit hook intercepts
- Context Intelligence Engine analyzes project state
- Hook injects smart directives based on complexity

### 2. ZEN Orchestration Begins
- Hook guidance triggers appropriate ZEN tools
- ZEN performs deep analysis and planning
- Creates execution roadmap with agent recommendations

### 3. Claude Flow Executes
- Spawns recommended agent swarms
- Coordinates parallel execution
- Manages memory and state

### 4. Hooks Monitor Progress
- PreToolUse validates operations
- PostToolUse tracks results
- Learning system improves over time

## 📋 Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py"
      }]
    }],
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command", 
        "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session_start.py"
      }]
    }],
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.py"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Critical Rules Enforced by Hooks

### The Golden Rule: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"
- Hooks detect sequential operations and enforce batching
- TodoWrite must include 5-10+ todos in ONE call
- Task agents must be spawned concurrently
- File operations must be grouped together

### MCP Tool Separation
- **MCP Tools**: Coordination, planning, memory (never execution)
- **Claude Code**: All actual execution, file operations, coding
- Hooks prevent MCP tools from attempting execution

### Agent Orchestration Patterns
- Always start with ZEN analysis for complex tasks
- Use swarm topologies (mesh, hierarchical, ring, star)
- Spawn 3-12 agents based on task complexity
- Coordinate through memory and hooks

## 🔥 Power User Features

### Context Intelligence Engine
The UserPromptSubmit hook uses advanced context analysis:
- Git status and branch detection
- Technology stack identification  
- User expertise level adaptation
- Progressive verbosity adjustment

### Neural Learning System
Hooks learn from your patterns:
- Tracks successful operations
- Builds pattern recognition
- Improves recommendations over time
- Adapts to your development style

### Override Mechanism
When hooks block necessary operations:
- `FORCE:` - General override
- `OVERRIDE:` - Explicit bypass
- `QUEEN_ZEN_APPROVED:` - Critical overrides
- Include justification for audit trail
